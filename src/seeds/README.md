# Seeds for Barn

Welcome to the `seeds` directory of Barn, the terminal-based IDE with a rustic charm. In keeping with our barnyard theme, we call our extensions and add-ons "Seeds."

## What are Seeds?

Seeds in Barn are akin to plugins or extensions in other IDEs. They are additional packages that you can "plant" into your IDE to grow new functionalities or enhance existing ones. Just like seeds in a farm, these packages have the potential to grow and evolve, enriching the Barn ecosystem.

## Purpose of Seeds

The primary purpose of Seeds is to provide a flexible and modular approach to adding new features to Barn. They allow users to customize and extend their IDE experience according to their individual needs. Whether it's a new syntax highlighter, a version control system interface, or a unique code analysis tool, Seeds can bring these functionalities to life.

## What Should Seeds Become?

Seeds should aim to be:
- **User-Friendly:** Easy to install, configure, and use.
- **Reliable:** Stable and well-tested to ensure they don't disrupt the core IDE experience.
- **Performant:** Efficient in their operation, not hindering the IDE's performance.
- **Secure:** Safe to use, protecting the user's code and data.
- **Collaborative:** Encouraging community contributions and improvements.
